\chapter{Conclusions}\label{cap:conclusoeseperspectivas}

This work has shown the development of \textit{zCart}, a functional smart cart
prototype using computer vision and sensor data, the same technological
framework used on similar commercial products. The prototype development has
successfully reached all of the desired objectives including the training of a
object detection model and developing an interactive user interface.

The real time performance achieved using the selected hardware was sufficient
for our purposes, at around 4 FPS with the EffiecientDet-D2 model, which showed an
average precision above 80\% during validation.

Additionally, we were able to present some of the challenges and future work
discussions related to the current state of the prototype and also its cost
structure.

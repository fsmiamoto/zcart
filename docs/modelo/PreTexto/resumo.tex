The recent advancements in artificial intelligence have already impacted many
aspects of modern life but have yet to impact one important aspect of the
consumer experience in a meaningful way: shopping in physical stores. Tech
giants such as Amazon have recently deployed the so called \textit{smart
carts} to their physical retail stores, allowing customers to have an
improved shopping experience, including better product information and a
seamless checkout process. In that regard, this work analyses the current
market and describes the development of a prototype that achieves similar
functionality to the ones currently available, using the same building
blocks such as computer vision and sensor data. A \textit{Deep Learning}
model was developed for product detection and deployed to a single board
computer capable of running inferences at 4 FPS with an average precision 
higher than  80\%. Finally, this work discusses the challenges and
practical constraints of developing such a prototype and also presents 
suggestions for future work to improve the solution into a commercial 
product.
